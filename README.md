## Disclamer
Parody of Japanese Google based on a meme, this account is not affiliated with Google in any way.

Inspiration came from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thomastheplankengine/comments/186zgb8/had_a_dream_japanese_google_was_called_japoogle/), credit to u/Merpyderpysoup for the original idea.
